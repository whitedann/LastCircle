TO BUILD A NEW WORLD FILE:

The first line is two numbers consisting of the height and width of the map.
The second line is two numbers consisting of the starting tile index of the player
Then, create a grid i by j numbers in dimension. A "1" corresponds to a floor tile,
and a "0" corresponds to a brick (wall) tile. "world1.txt" is a basic example of this,
with all floor tiles surrounded by a boundary of wall tiles.

TO BUILD A NEW SPAWN PATTERN:

The dimensions of the spawn pattern must be the same as the world it is designed for.
